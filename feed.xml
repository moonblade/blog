  &lt;p&gt;Trying to see if proper writing is a thing for me or not. Theres no way I’m writing 1.5k words every single day. Here’s a start though. 1k words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was driving back along the interstate, heading home after another tough day at work. I worked at an architecture firm in LA, a career I’d dreamed about since high school. I’d managed to get into one of the best colleges, then landed an internship at the firm that eventually turned into a full-time role. Most days, I loved my job; it was everything I’d hoped for, and most clients were receptive to my ideas. But lately, a few clients had been incredibly nit-picky, asking for redesigns over the smallest details—at least, that’s how it felt to me. The work was still fun, though. Unfortunately, my boss had just assigned me a new client, and any argument that my current projects needed priority didn’t seem to change his mind. Oh well, I’d just have to see how this new client turned out and hope they were more agreeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts were spiraling as I got caught up in work worries again, so I started fiddling with the radio, hoping to find something to lift my mood. To my delight, one of my favorite songs was playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nodding along to the music, I took the off-ramp and let myself unwind, shifting into weekend mode. Just as I was pulling into my neighborhood, my phone started buzzing. “Hey, shorty,” I answered, guessing it was probably Jesse. Driving one-handed on the phone wasn’t ideal, but it was the suburbs, and I was going slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey, soup, I got it!” Her excitement was unmistakable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The last round was a bit dicey, but they liked the presentation enough to green-light the project.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Congrats, shorty. That’s great! Now you get to be your own boss, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well… kinda. I still have to submit updates every week, but mostly, yeah. Plus, I get to boss around a couple of interns. It’ll be fun.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I turned a corner, I noticed an old homeless man pushing a cart along the sidewalk. “Listen, I’m almost home. Victory lunch at my place tomorrow?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt my eyes drawn to the man; we made eye contact, his emerald eyes pulling me in, he smirked at me, and mouthed a word. Huh, Did he just say sorry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRASH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What was that? Eli? …Eli?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lay on a stretcher, the hum of the vehicle surrounding me like a fog. Voices echoed around me, muffled as I tried to piece together what had happened. The harsh lights and sounds of what I assumed was an ambulance did nothing for my nausea. “What happened?” I managed to ask in a weak voice, attempting to sit up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sir, you have a concussion. Please lie back down,” the EMT said steadily. “It looks like you were in a pretty bad crash. Your car was upside down when we found you.” He gave me a reassuring smile. “You were extremely lucky, though; it seems you only have a concussion. Still, we need to confirm everything at the ER.” I tried to slip back into unconsciousness, but the EMT wouldn’t let me. “Sir, I need you to stay awake for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctor confirmed the concussion once we got to the ER. “You were in a serious accident, but fortunately, no fractures or internal bleeding—just some bruises and a mild head injury,” he said in a calm, practiced tone. “Your brain took a bit of a hit, so you might feel nauseous, dizzy, and have a headache for a few days, but these should clear up on their own. Take it easy—no heavy lifting, no intense concentration, and avoid screens if possible. Have someone check in on you every few hours for the next day or two.” He paused before adding, “Rest is important, but try to stay awake for a few more hours. We’ll monitor your symptoms, and if everything looks good, we’ll discharge you. Sound good?”. I was about to answer when I sensed someone at the door, frantically racing to get to the ER. As I turned to the door, it burst open, and I saw a short redhead looking frantically around the room. Jesse spotted me, and her expression turned from panic to relief in seconds. “What the hell happened? I was beside myself with worry. They wouldn’t tell me anything except that you were in a crash.” The doctor gave her a stern look but sighed and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey… hey… look at me. Breathe… I’m all right. Just a concussion. See? I’m all right.” I tried to reassure her as I sat up, making space for her to sit on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What happened, soup?” Her use of that goofy nickname told me she was calming down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s the thing—I don’t know. I got distracted by something on the sidewalk. But I was going slow, maybe thirty at most, and there was nothing to hit. I was in the middle of the road.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve told you a million times not to answer the phone while you’re driving. Why don’t you ever listen?” she scolded. I tried to think of a comeback, but the headache and nausea clouded my thoughts. I lay back down, exhaling slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know. Maybe I just wanted to hear your voice,” I said with a tired smile. “But I still don’t think the phone caused the accident. We’ll know for sure tomorrow when I check out my car.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; go check out your car, you mean. You’re not going anywhere,” she countered, her tone softening as she reached out, lightly brushing her fingers against mine. “I’m really glad you’re okay,” she murmured, leaning in and before I knew it, we were kissing. Her eyes widened slightly, a blush creeping up to her ears. “Uh… yeah, I’m glad,” she said, looking away, and I couldn’t help the grin that spread across my face. This was new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t I treat you to a victory dinner instead.” Jesse said, helping me out of the car in front of my apartment building. “You know I’m fine right? The headache is gone, I can walk around and stand by myself. See…“, I said, walking a few steps ahead of her, promptly losing my balance and almost falling. “Yah.  you showed me.”, laughing she took my hand, steadying me. “Come on Mr balance, let’s get you to your apartment”.  As we walked to the elevator, I smiled at the feeling of her hand in mine, We had known each other since forever, were in the same grade school, and have been inseparable pretty much since. Calling her my best friend would be an understatement. She knew more about me than anyone else alive. I was excited to see where this new turn would take us. We hit the elevator button and were waiting for it to arrive. Huh, someone’s in the elevator, I wonder who’s up this late. The elevator door opened and an old man stepped out. His emerald green eyes faintly flashing in the dark. I was hit with a feeling of déjà vu, like I’d seen him before. I was about to get in when it hit me, freezing me in place. It was the guy, the homeless guy, from the crash. I quickly spun around speaking aloud. “hey, you! Stop!”. There was no one behind me though. “Who are you talking to? Are you all right?” Jesse was looking at me, concern clear on her face. “What do you mean? the old man that just stepped out of the elevator. He was there when the crash happened” I said, still looking around. ”What old man? The elevator was empty!”. I finally looked up and saw her expression. I sighed and straightened up. “Nothing, its nothing. Let’s go”. She didn’t buy it, but she let it go and we made our way to my apartment. I stood in front of my door, slowly doing an impression of a koi fish. “Uhh, I just realised my key is in my car, and that’s in an impound somewhere“. “Well, its good at that at least one of us is smart”, she pulled out a set of duplicate keys that I’d lent her from her purse and proceeded to open the door, leaving me feeling distinctly idiotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She left for the guest bathrooms, stating “Let me freshen up, and we’ll make something simple for dinner.” I sidled into the kitchen, taking inventory of the pantry and the refrigerator. I found a half full bottle of red in the fridge, and a bit of a cheese for us to nibble on while making dinner. Pouring a couple of glasses I nibbled on a bit of cheese continuing to take stock. We could make some pasta, I had a couple of pieces of chicken parm from yesterday that would go well with it. That decided, I got to prepping the ingredients, cutting some mushrooms and garlic. I was finishing up the prep when I heard her coming up from behind. “Let’s make pasta. I’ve started the water, and here’s all the ingredients. I’ll go take my turn now”. I turned around to see her sneaking towards the kitchen with cartoonish exaggerated motions. “What are you even doing?” I asked holding back a laugh.“ “You’re no fun, what? You have eyes on the back of your head now? I was trying to scare you.” “Well, Bigfoot, you should be better at making no noise for that to work”. “Ugh. Go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the hot shower, I was thinking about the crazy day I just had, about the old man who I’d run into twice now, and I couldn’t help the notion that he was responsible for the crash taking root in his mind. I was ruminating on how that would even be possible when I noticed Jesse pacing outside the bathroom door. “What is it?” I asked in a loud voice, turning off the shower for a bit, ”Do you have any oregano?” She asked. “Ya, in the bottom drawer, it would be with the spices”. She went back to the kitchen and a small note of confusion bubbled up from the background thoughts. How had I known she was there? For that matter how had I known there was someone in the elevator before it opened?. I realised I was vaguely aware of what was going on in the kitchen, I could make out a blob moving around and motioning towards the stove, I figured Jesse was putting the finishing touches on the pasta. Okay, that was just freaky. This day just kept getting weirder and weirder. I forced myself to stop thinking about it for now, I’m all out of brain cells for today, This is for tomorrow me. Instead I thought about Jesse and the kiss. I had had a crush on her a while now, but hadn’t done anything about it for fear of ruining the friendship. To know that the feelings was reciprocated was a relief. Towelling off, and putting on a fresh pair of clothes, I made my way to the kitchen to see Jesse setting up plates with fresh pasta and topping it with the chicken parm, cut into smaller pieces. “This looks amazing”, I said, grating a solid helping of Parmesan on both our plates and setting up the wine glasses. “Cheers”, clinking our glasses, taking a sip of wine, we started digging in with relish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#worldbuilding #novel #nanowrimo #teekay #tk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Same world as ours, makes background work less daunting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hidden super world&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mc thinks hes the only one for a while, before opening up into the wider super community
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;ascension&quot;&gt;Ascension&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supers grow into their powers, when fully merged, they ascend to a different realm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General health benefits and longer living as they grow into their powers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ones in charge end up being people attached to worldly views but not the elite at power
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;at any point in time, there are some elites, above the people in charge in terms of raw power, but they are rarely interested in contesting since they have their own thing.
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;being-super&quot;&gt;Being super&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supers gain their powers, if they have latent abilities, when under duress, it doesn’t present immediately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The threshold is much lower for the progeny of a super.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It used to be much harder earlier, then a powerful super named xylion with nature powers appeared, he created the network, a mutation that spreads from tree to tree, uniting them into a singular network working together to increase the amount of mana in the ground, making it more abundant in the world, and increasing the number of supers that appear as a consequence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evolution&quot;&gt;Evolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A super gains one power at the start, then depending on their potential, they might unlock related skills. A person who can turn invisible might learn later that they can also cast forcefields. Some of it is just not knowing what your power is. As it might be that you think you only have a subset of your powers. Theres no manual or instruction or floating window. So you have to experiment. Its like a new muscle, so it takes time to be good at it, and also to find uses for it and use it in new situations. When a power evolves, its usually due to the person trying to use it in a new way under heightened emotional state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What persistent daydreams do you have? Do you have any that you keep consistently coming back to and keep world building on it till it now has a life of its own. Welcome to one of mine. If the first step of your daydream is to take over the world, you know it’s going to be a doozy, so strap in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you take over the world. How you may ask. You know the grey goo, it’s like that, but more controlled. So you have self replicating nanotech, from far enough in the future that it’s magic to the current folks and un-hackable, that goes out into the world, learns to convert matter into energy for self sustenance and the reverse of replication. Give it a hive AI and now you’re cooking. So this AI takes over the world, but its primary directive is simple. Stay hidden. It gets into literally everything, its in your body, its in your tech and its in the water. But since it can take over what you perceive, it’s a simple enough matter to stay hidden by avoiding being in the places you look. You take a syringe of blood, it’s moved away, you look at water under a microscope, it’s a bit farther to the left. On the off chance that you do catch it, it diverts your attention away from it while deleting any traces of it in your equipment in real time. So ya, you’ve successfully taken control of the world, and thats step one complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you get to introduce this tech to the world, but you do it in stages and with a lot of misdirection. You create a new website, a shopping website similar to amazon, but much much simpler. Theres only one product listed. The “Phone”. Its listed at 1$, or the local equivalent. To anyone with any brains, it looks to be a scam website designed to steal your credit card information. This is where you hook them. Once you find someone who’s gullible enough, or someone who’s just playing along, to get to the page and click the buy icon. It doesn’t go to a payment page, instead it just says, place a dollar bill (or local equivalent) in front of you. Once done, it runs an animation irl, with the dollar bill vanishing out and a pair of glasses sliding in from nowhere. This is simple enough to make one with the nanotech as and when needed right in front of them, giving them the illusion that it just slid out. Now they are definitely intrigued. Obviously you want someone with clout to be the one trying this out first and informing others, so you give the link to MKBHD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time he wears the glasses, theres a simple scan animation, it gives a photo of him and a voice says “marques brownlee…..welcome”. Thus the intro. The on screen voice/text notifies that full functionalities are locked and that it’s still running on restricted mode, with no obvious ways of enabling it all. It asks you to look at your phone, and when you do you get a clone of it on screen, and anything you do syncs back to your phone, since nanotech has invaded your phone as well. Theres a piece of rectangular glass that comes with the glasses that you can use as a surface for the phone, and with real time tracking its impossible to distinguish between a real phone and an overlay on the rectangular glass. At this point the tech is locked down enough that you can only replicate tech that you personally have bought and own. You cannot replicate a tech and then sell this. This is intended to save every corporation from going into bankruptcy at the same time, and giving them a lead time of five years until the restrictions come off. Since none of the tech is actually in the glasses and the entire thing is an overlay layer on the nano tech AI, the glasses are swappable, so if someone else uses the same pair of glasses they see their own screen and not the other persons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the AI has infiltrated all tech, and it waited long enough decades to act to ensure that it got into any secure off grid backups, it has carte blanche on knowledge and the internet, so it copies the whole thing into itself and makes a deduped version of it without lag; the only reason cache exists on the internet is because the network is slow, if everything were running on the same lan, you would only be capped by the lan speed, if everything where running on the same machine you’d have only processor speed to content with, since the single AI is running the whole shebang, you get instant access to information from anywhere on the internet. You call it earth wifi, and anyone who has access to a glass can connect to earth wifi, which just toggles them from the public internet on to the ai one, again back-syncing changes for eventual consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you get into augmented reality, since the users are starting to get more comfortable with having information on their faces, you provide more information in less screen like fashion, you look at a bowl of cereal and instead of the calorie information being on a floating screen above it, its on a post it near it on the counter. You slowly get the information thats read only to be more integrated with the world and less like a screen. But you keep your inputs still in a traditional format, look at any keyboard/trackpad/mouse once to pair and you can use it for your input needs. or just stare at a flat surface to project a keyboard on it, or use a piece of rectangular plastic in a usecase similar to your phone, with the keyboard or the screen tracked on to it. This gives privacy since only a single user will see the content and unless they choose to share it, noone else has access to the same information. Similarly, for content creators, looking at a camera can also share the view to the camera, for easy demo-ing of the tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you break into the global market and your userbase is measured in a percentage of global population, you go onto the next phase. A system message pops up asking do you trust me. And if you click yes, it allows you to pick a different form factor for your device, from a ring to a necklace to a watch, anything that touches you constantly but doesn’t have to be on your face, you still get the full functionality and immersive experience without the glasses. Till now it had pretended to be tech in the glasses, now its out of the window, theres no way you’re believing that the ring on the hand that you’re hiding behind your back is able to project any image into your retinas, and you realize that it has control of your perception. At this point you lose a huge percentage of your userbase, so about 90 % of those will go back to using previous era devices and never come back, but the ones who go on either because they don’t care or any other reason, you go ahead with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You give them more prompts, “I see that you have cancer, would you like this cured”. Since the nano techs are in their body, it’s a simple enough procedure to remove foreign matter, and you go forward with more stuff, “Would you like this limb to be regrown”. It only ever asks once, and only if it thinks that this is something you might want, if its part of your identity, it gives you a choice, but doesn’t provide a preference and you choose the one you like. It gives you the option to change your choices later, it doesn’t check your voice though, it checks your thoughts to check your needs. So unless you actually want something changed, you’re not getting it. Thus physical limitations become a thing of the past for the few who fully embrace the tech, getting fitter, living longer, regrowing limbs, and being able to convert into their preferred bodies. It gets into a moral dilemma of whether having an extra chromosome is something to be fixed, and instead resolves to give it as an option that can be taken instead of something to be fixed. The others slowly get into the tech since it starts offering a potential cure for many an ailments that seems to trump regular medicine, improving world wide adoption again. With improved health-span, the early adopters have much to gain from the tech. Due to logistical issues with converting to an amortal society, amortality is never given as an option.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">What persistent daydreams do you have?

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t your pristine alfredo, this is bastardized for tricking you into thinking its healthy by dumping some veggies in it. Bite me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chicken breast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Penne pasta&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chicken stock (This is bastardized, get all the way off my back about it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Garlic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Veggies (Any that you like)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Brocolli&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cherry Tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pepper&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Carrots&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cucumber&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Spinach&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Mushrooms&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good parmesan cheese&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fresh cream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean chicken breast, pat it dry and add black pepper and salt on both sides. Keep it aside to marinate for a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prep all veggies, blanch any like brocolli that require it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a layer of neutral oil in a sort of deep dish and put your chicken breasts whole in it. Get both sides properly roasted.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pro Tip: Lower heat and close the lid to get juicier chicken&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pro Tip: Once chicken is done, take it off the heat and cover it so that it will steam in its own heat to get juicy interior and crispy exterior.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heat chicken stock, or if you’re a puritan, water with salt once boiling and add penne in it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While the pasta is going, add butter to the pan you made chicken in, add in garlic and get all that fond off the bottom, its flavour city in there, dont let it goto waste.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;At this point if you’re a puritan and don’t want to add any veggies make a roux with a bit of flour, and then add milk/cream etc once roux is done and ignore all veggie stuff&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add in veggies according to how much time they need. Cherry tomatoes first, then mushrooms, then most others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the veggies are mostly done, add in a dash of milk, and a lot of fresh cream.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grate in good parmesan cheese on it, and add some of the pasta water.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re looking for a sort of consistency were if you wipe the sauce away with the finger, the line remains sharp on the ladle and doesn’t immediatley get filled in.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Here you need to keep an eye on the sauce, if its too thick or splits, add some water/pasta water to re-emulsify it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once pasta is al dente, add it into your sauce and cook it there till its done. You can add some oregano if you like here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You know the chicken that you’d kept aside to steam, cut it into strips.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plate the pasta and plate the chicken on top of the pasta. Maybe grate some more parm on top&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’ve realized that I seem to be recommeding books and giving excerpts for them more often than I care to. So imma collate that info here so that next time I can just give the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hall-of-fame&quot;&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the content with a mix of genre’s but are in my top tier list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (Eliezer Yudkowsky)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fanfic in the harry potter world taking a look at how the story would have turned out had harry been rational (code for smarter). The antagonist in the story was amazingly well done.
The characters take on death and roles in life are so closely aligned with mine that it became an instant favourite.
This is a Rationality book masquerading as fanfiction, but the fanfiction portion of it is legitimately amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wanderinginn.com/&quot;&gt;Wandering inn&lt;/a&gt; (Pirateaba)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purely fantasy, with 11 million words, you can get amazing world building and intricate character work. By far my favourite work of fantasy world, this series has made my ugly cry multiple times due to how realistic the characters are, their wins are yours and you genuinely cheer at their growth.
Couple in a living world that changes and escalates as time goes on, its on the upper echelons of what a web series can achieve. Theres around 35 books worth of content already.
Genre: Epic Fantasy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bobiverse (Dennis E Taylor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A set of three books (the fourth one we shall not acknowledge) about a self replication von neuman probe exploring the galaxy, saving humanity, playing exobiologist and dealing with threats. 
Pure scifi bliss from start to finish and Ray porter does an excellent narration for the books.
Genre: SciFi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immune (Philipp Dettmer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy created kurzgesagt, obviously he’s good at explaning stuff. 
It is very rare that there are subject matter experts who can explain a concept in a way that is simple and easy to follow, this book does an amazing job of guiding us through how our immune systme works.
Genre: Science&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iron Prince (Bryce O connor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quintessential progression fantasy, guy is weak, but has secret that makes him get better faster. Puts in blood sweat and tears to get stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fiction&quot;&gt;Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;litrpg--progression-fantasy&quot;&gt;LitRPG / Progression Fantasy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is pretty much 90% of what I read. Progression Fantasy and LitRPG. Main character starts off weak and then becomes strong by the end. Most of it is series and not single books&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mother of learning (Nobody103)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy gets stuck in a timeloop, and has to learn enough magic to be able to stop a world ending disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cradle (Will Wight)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complete set of 12 books of our hero going from unpowered to truly overpowered. The epitome of progression fantasy with fun magic systems interesting characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The captain (Will Wight)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another will wight classic with magic and tech blend. This is the first time I’ve seen a fantasy setting mixed with scifi and it really pulls me in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The perfect run (Maxime Durand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time loops, super powers, aliens gods. Whats not to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dungeon Crawler Carl (Matt Dinniman)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the apocalypse, sponsored by…, the apocalypse has been taken over as a media routine by aliens, the main character is fighting against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ascend Online (Luke Chmilenko)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new VR world of a game to explore, and challenges to conquer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paranoid Mage (Inadvisably Compelled)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning how space magic works, this mage will start to overthrow the existing magical beurocracy to put something better in place&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mark of the Fool (J M Clarke)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On going in royal road. A mark from a god that debilitates you instead of empowering you, follow the MC as he realizes the true origins of the mark and fights against fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;epic-fantasy&quot;&gt;Epic Fantasy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sprawling kingdoms, magic and dragons spanning entire volumes of text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stormlight archive (Brandon Sanderson)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanderson is a prolific writer who takes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a-k6eaT-jQ&quot;&gt;breaks from books by writing other books&lt;/a&gt;. Stormlight archive takes place in an interconnected universe called cosmere that a lot of sanderson’s books takes place in.
The reawakening of an ancient order of magic. With amazing lore and world building and realistic portrayal of human issues in a backdrop of magic.
Follow along as multiple characters take their own journey and trials through the world, as they meet culminating the the typical sanderlanch of amazing endings to each book.
If new to sanderson, start with mistborn instead of this, as it a lot easier to take in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Expanse (James SA Corey)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A scifi epic, from humble beginnings to epic conclusions. Humanity expanding into the cosmos via artifacts left by unknown aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Name of the Wind (Pat Rothfuss)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The epitome of prose building, the story of an orphan becoming a mage. Abadoned by the author for a decade, so pick it up at your own peril knowing that the ending is unknown.
Yet the story told so far is so good that its still good to have read at least once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discworld (Terry Pratchet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of 40 books, multiple series taking place in the same titular discworld. The city watch being my favourite.
The character growth and the world building is second to none. Some amazing heartfelt moments buried in endless fun romps through the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sci-fi&quot;&gt;Sci Fi&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Project Hail Mary (Any Weir)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those believe the best of sentience and a feel good happy endings kind of book. The perfect antidote you need after reading liu cixin’s three-body problem series and being depressed about aliens.
Guy meets an alien and has to work together to solve an issue earth and the alien world is facing. Its really optimistic and has you leaving with warm feelings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three Body Problem (Liu Cixin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each book in the series raises the stakes by an order of magnitude byt boy does it pay off. A look on interstellar politics and why we are alone.
Read it if you want to be afraid of aliens forever. The what if’s on the edges of scifi are the cherry on the cake here, like superliminal travel or higher dimensions and why dont exist anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Martian (Andy weir)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the love and effort he has put into this book with the amount of research he has done for all the calculations and what ifs that happen in the book.
Astronaut gets stuck on mars and his journey to survive in this harsh environment and finally getting rescued. The tone of the book which is in first person is amazing, with snarky humour throughout.
RC Bray did the original performance of the audiobook and it was amazing, and amazon decided nope, we need wil wheatons voice instead which is nowhere near as good. Dont get the wil wheaton one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skyward (Brandon Sanderson)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series with light magic, and more tech, but with all the class sandersonisms. A secret world hisory to uncover and aliens to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Children of Time (Adrian Tchaikovsky)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first book in the series sprawling multiple thousands of years. The latter books are a bit disappointing, but the first is good enough alone that it is worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Magic 2.0 Series (Scott mayer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is a computer simulation and you can manipulate reality by editing the program. 
Follow along on this fun lighthearted adventure as the protagonist discovers magic and meets other time travellers who found the same program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regular-plain-old-fiction&quot;&gt;Regular plain old fiction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Man Called Ove (Fredrik Backman)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t expect to love this story as much as I did. A cantankerous old man trying to end his life gets distracted by his neighbour and eventually realizes that he has the strength to go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stories of Your Life and Others (Ted Chiang)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy has the brilliant ability to make you dream up a world with a few short words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story of your life: is about how language affects our thinking, and taking it to the extreme. This ended up with me in a rabbit hole exploring different languages and how it affects behaviour. Got way way too into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand: The process of someone going from human to superhuman in as short a work as possible. This was by far my favourite ted chiang short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The complete Sherlock Holmes Collection (Arthur Conan Doyle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requires no introduction, you know you’ve made it if your name is a verb. The original stories are well worth the read.
The novels are a hit and miss for me, but the short stories and by and large amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fault in our stars (John Green)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life’s unfair. A touching story of a short lived love. Of expectations and bucket list trips and unfinished stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perks of being a wallflower (Stephen Chbosky)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gives a dive into the perspective of a wallflower. Has some really powerful scenes. Good overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;misc&quot;&gt;Misc&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yumi and the Nightmare Painter (Brandon Sanderson)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year of sanderson special, a one off that stuck with me. Has classic sanderlanch, and good character work and really interesting premise that hooks you from start to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Sword of Kaigen ( M L Wang)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World building done well, to be able to tease a wide world at a tenth of the word count is a skill few possess. This feels like a book much bigger than it is because it brushes on events that gives it a solid hefty feeling of character history. Excellent character work and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legends &amp;amp; Lattes (Travis Baldree)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voice actor turned author, he creates a comfy book that you just want to hug and enjoy. A low stakes book that still hits all the right notes while evoking a feeling of home and hearth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;non-fiction&quot;&gt;Non Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;science&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Code Book (Simon Singh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really good book on cryptography and its history. Amazing read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Order of Time (Carlo Rovelli)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does time work, why does it go forward but not back. A look into the emerging concept of time, and why we feel it passing. Might give a bit of a light existential crisis in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Gene: An Intimate History (Sidhartha Mukherjee)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made me go from having a bunch of random assorted knowledge about random gene stuff to having a really good interconnected web of knowledge of gene, crispr, heredity and more.
Theres questionable interleaved personal story there which I didn’t care much for. This was the first time I fell in love with science books and realizing that fun books are a legitimate way to gain knowledge. Till then I had an association of knowledge with dry books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Elegant Universe (Brian greene)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian green does an elegant explanation of string theory thats understandable to the layman. Thats rare, being a subject expert and being a good communicator. Books from them are a gem to read.
He chaperones us through relativity, and quantum mechanics and need for string theory and the latest in the field during the time of writing. Informative&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forces of Nature (Brian Cox)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explanations on the four fundamental forces and how our universe behaves as it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Epigenetics Revolution (Nessa Carey)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the subject matter is good and a natural progression after “The Gene”, the language and clarity of the book leaves a bit to be desired. There is good content, its just a bit harder to get through and presented in a less interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What If (Randall Munroe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randall is always a pleasure to read, the amount of effort he puts it to research an absurd hypothetical is truly mind boggling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;people-or-corporations-memoirs-or-corporate-history&quot;&gt;People or corporations (memoirs or corporate history)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Permanent Record (Ed Snowden)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A terrifying look at the capabilities of the NSA and how blowing the whistle on it affected his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth (Chris Hadfield)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How he got selected for going to space when a space program didn’t even exist in his country. And what it taught him about life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shoe Dog (Phil Knight)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the origins of Nike and how it went from a simple store to the multi national brand it is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Console wars (Blake J Harris)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first foray into non fiction that I actually liked. The fight between sega and nintendo, the release of sonic the hedgehog and how the upstart sega held its own against the mighty nintendo.
Its a fun read but with a david vs goliath sort of tone. Its conclusion is evident from history, but the journey is still interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creativity Inc (Ed Catmull)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixar and how it made each of its movies. Advesities they faced and their responses to it. Good read, but maybe nothing to write home about. I’d liked it at the time of reading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A promised land (Barack Obama)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A look at his time in office, his goals and regrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Musk (Ashely Vance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About Musk and how he started up his various enterprises. Theres a tiny bit of hero worship in there, but overall pretty good. Balances the tone well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (Yuval Harari)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A look through mankinds evolution and migrations and building of societies. A really good read for a comprehensive history of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A short history of nearly everything (Bill Bryson)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A meandering walk through history touching upon random milestones in humanity. My introduction to bill bryson and his signature tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Second World War (Antony Beevor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really good look at the events surrounding world war II. For the first world war, The podcast hardcore history by Dan Carlin was an excellent source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Money: The True Story of a Made-Up Thing (Jacob goldstein)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How money came into being and why its going to stick around. A weekend read. Not much worth retaining though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;misc-1&quot;&gt;Misc&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Psychology of Money (Morgan Housel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of what to do with money, instead it advices on how to think of money. If nothing else, the one take away is don’t invest optimally to make the most profit, invest in such a way that will help you sleep soundly. This single advice was worth reading through the whole book for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moneyball (Michael Lewis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How statistics got introduced into professional gaming. A bit overblown, but fun still&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mythos (Stephen Fry)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intro to norse mythology read in the dulcet tones of Stephen Fry. If you’ve ever wondered how your favourite norse characters interacted with each other, immerse yourself in to the stories told about them and how they influenced the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freakonomics (Steven Levitt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A use case for economics in things you wouldn’t think of. Its a lazy weekend read, its not a gain info kind of read more of a huh, thats neat kind of read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hall-of-lame&quot;&gt;Hall of Lame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Things I’ve read based on recommendations from others and realized that I’m so far out of the target audience demographic that its not even funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pride and Prejudice (Jane Austen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a bad romcom movie, now make so that everyone’s a prude from 1800’s. Add in a ton of will-they-won’t-they and tada you have pride and prejudice.
It might have been hot shit when it first came out. But now its just meh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alchemist (Paulo Coelho)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloyingly optimistic. Do your best and the world will conspire to make your dream comes true. Well the world you knock your teeth out when you’re looking directly at it instead of helping you, so this book can just go suck a lime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rationality from AI to zombies (Eliezer Yudkowsky)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny how my favourite and least favourite books are by the same author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m giving up on recording the nonsensical half remembered dream and trying to make a sensible through line to it, and instead taking the dream as a starting off point and fleshing it out more so that its actually readable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the dream and realised that this was the second time I’ve had this same exact dream. So made an effort to remember some of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She runs in sheer terror looking around for anything that might help. Grey marble lines the corridor with nothing on it. Out of options, her only move is to get to the classroom at the end of the corridor hoping there would be someone who could help. She knew that death was only a few paces behind. She can’t help but look over her shoulder and sees me extending a black shadowed claw towards her neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She can make the animals she draws come to life” Her parents explained. I nodded along. “yes, I believe this will be a good place for her. “. “Thank you”. “Good day”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmf. What did they know. I asked her to demonstrate her abilities. And she dutifully took out a colouring book and drew a tiny hound. Shadow coalesced on top of the page and a tiny pup wriggled it’s way out of the page wreathed in black smoke. Ha, I knew it. An invoker. A powerful one at that. This should be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But if you bring your drawings to life. Why is the drawing still left on the page after they stand up. And what’s with the shadow or smoke dripping from it”, Jason asked herl. He was nice enough and they had taken to sharing their lunch breaks together, he had come up behind her while she was practicing her drawing and seen the animal rise up. It was never exactly as she had drawn it, she had drawn a cute puppy, and while the resulting creature was still cute, it seemed like it had sharper fangs, and sharper claws than the drawing. She was experimenting to try and see if she could change that. “Because thats just how my power works”, she replied. “Thats just a copout and you know it. You know, I heard one of the professors say that you had the same powers as the dean”. “Thats interesting, I’ve never seen him draw anything before. Maybe I’ll ask him to teach me more sometime”. “Ooh this drawing looks good, its really lifelike”, he says flipping through the other pages. I see the picture of the peacock he’s looking at. “Ya, that took me a bit, I want to get faster”. “Can’t you remove some details to go faster?”, “And have lame ugly monsters running around? ha not a chance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean I’m not ready for it yet.”. “Its simple, you’re not ready to learn more at this stage, as it is dangerous”. “Ya right, as if a few drawings could do anything to me”.  “Very well, if you wish to learn how to use your power effectively, prove to me that you have mastered the basics of it, protect yourself”. “Wait what!”, she says, her voice rising an octave. As she watches, three massive hounds materialize from black smoke behind him, rippling with muscles and gnashing their teeth, they snarl at her and wait for their master to release them. In horror she watches as the dean transforms in front of her eyes, his robes curl with black smoke which cascade over his entire body, locking into chitinous armour around him, the shoulder blades expanding into black leathery wings, two cruved horns growing from his face and the fingers elongating into claws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She put on a burst of speed and evaded the claw by mere inches, she got in the classroom and jammed the door shut. There was a class going on, the professor looked at her expectantly, “Yes?”. She couldn’t speak yet, she was out of breath. She got to the board and started drawing a peacock, in her experiments, she had found that the birds she made were always much more agressive and would devour the others. It had made no sense to her why a peacock had been so aggressive and capable to the point that not only where other animals were afraid of it, the others birds were too. She had to do be fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crack!. you could see the wood splintering as four claws dragged their way across the door as if it was paper. It made another swipe vertically and more door fell apart. “Do not be alarmed”, the professor intoned to the anxious students in the room, visibly relaxing after seeing the claw, “This is just a demonstration”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She got all through the beak and body and was about to start on the plumage when she saw the dean walking through the hole in the door, looking like his normal self, and there were three puppies near his feet as well, running around, chasing each other. The students awwed forgetting the claws they had seen earlier. The dean got closer and said, “Too slow, I gave you an entire minute before I came in, though I made a lot of noise, and you still do not have a defense ready”. “But, but..”. “Listen, your power is not bringing your drawings to life. You are a shadow invoker”. “Huh?”. “Well, it means the monsters come from here” He said tapping at his temple “And not from here”, he said pointing to her half finished drawing. “Practice with less details, the drawing is a focus, to help your mind, make it so that your mind can see more.”. He took the chalk from me and drew with the flat side of the chalk. And like caligraphy, with a few deft strokes, a silhoute that suggested a peacock stood in front of me. It hadn’t taken him three seconds. “Practice”. He said, turning around leaving through the ruined door. He muttered something under his breath while leaving causing tendrlis of black smoke to snake out from the cut edges of the door, slowly snake their way across the floor, pick up the individual pieces and within minutes, reassemble it into a door that was unnoticeable to how it was before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;why a peacock
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;no clue, mind thought i could draw it easier maybe? dunno.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what part of these are from the dream
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the chase and the lecture afterward&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Observations from a fly on the wall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans say a lot of stuff, and do something else, what a person is to an outside observer could be summed up as their actions. But to ourselves, each action has a trail of reasons, circustances, and exceptions trailing behind it. 
Muddling through our day to day life, our actions sing a duet called interaction, changing us in subtle ways too slow to notice. Over the course of time, we are molded without our ever realizing it. 
A lot of us look back on the process, wondering at the twists and turns, Some few look upon it in the present, finding an upcoming fork. A rare few have what it takes to turn into a path, even fewer to turn away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, most of us are able to rest a while, look at the way we’ve come, and marvel that we made it this far. Think about the significant figures that affected our paths, the ones we spent the most time with, or the ones that touched us most.
The figures that play such a pivotal role could be total strangers, though more often than not, they are closer to home than that. The more you have interacted with a person, the higher the chance that they have already shifted your path. 
The more force someone can exert on you, the more they may be able to shift you, or the more they may steady you when you drift. This tangible force, this connection, is a hard fought reward. 
We might not notice it, but it takes a lot of investment to have it. We might have invested in dribs and drabs over the course of years, but it compounds to something deep rooted and steady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactions when observed in any particular instant of time will never reveal the immense history of interactions that built this connection.
Experiences of love, loss, temper and tranquility that over time built, not a perfect connection but a deep one. 
But the more you observe, the more you catch a glimpse, out of the corner of your eye, of the vastness of the underlying connection, and you can’t help but be awestruck by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some rare few times, connections could spring up instantly and last for the rest of time. 
At others, connections once thought to be rock solid, might erode over time and distance till it is a mere shadow of its former self.
All told, they help us navigate this maze of life and treat it as if it were a path with a destination and that we had a plan all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connections strengthen and weaken, build anew or fade away, throughout the course of our path, and like actors in a play, 
we watch and mouth our lines, never stepping foot outside our intended roles, never hoping for more than we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, heres to breaking our shackles and aiming higher. To abrupt lousy endings and better connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="bsdiary" /><summary type="html">Observations from a fly on the wall</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Travels and travails</title><link href="http://moonblade.github.io/blog/2022/08/28/travels.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Travels and travails" /><published>2022-08-28T18:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-08-28T18:30:00+00:00</updated><id>http://moonblade.github.io/blog/2022/08/28/travels</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://moonblade.github.io/blog/2022/08/28/travels.html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A long trip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mumbai&quot;&gt;Mumbai&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m bored, I should prolly travel around a bit, expand my horizons, absorb some culture, see how life on the other side is like and all that. I’ve never taken a solo trip before, wonder how it’ll go. I don’t want it to end up with just me in a corner not talking with anyone and not liking it. You know what. No. This time around, I’ll talk to people, I claim it as the stated goal of the trip. Be able to have five min conversation with random strangers without issue. Seems like a reasonable goal. Right. Theres this hostel chain called zostel, seems like a good way to meet people who might be interested in talking to strangers. Okay thats a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t wanna wait around to get my bag from a conveyor belt, so I need something that I can carry on, but something big enough to have enough clothes for one or two weeks. Well, I don’t have anything like that, so fuck it, let’s buy one. One impulse shopping session later, I’m the proud owner of a backpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping straight into zostel might be too much for me, let’s ease into it by going to a friends place first. I have a friend in mumbai, let’s call her mal. Figured I’d stay a week at mal’s talk to her friend group, see how it goes when I have someone introducing me around without having to take the hard step of walking upto a stranger and talking. If I can’t even do this, then the trip is doomed to fail. So thats week one planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booked a flight on a sunday, annoyed my brother to drive me to the airport and finally boarded the flight. Having just carry on is fun on a flight, you just walk in, not having to talk to anyone.(….Oh. I wonder if I should change that.) and just getting a boarding pass from the machine and passing through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached her place by ten pm and got immediately whisked to a game night at her friends place with like ten people I’ve never met. Well, hit the ground running I guess. Met the lot of them and played mafia and cards for a while with them. Even moderating a game or two. Had dinner there and came back by 1 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a pasta recipe that I keep in my backpocket and whenever I want to impress someone I pull it out. I was bored and didn’t have much work, so figured I’d try that out. Raided the pantry and found most of the stuff needed, since it was veggie pasta, could just throw together whatever was in there. Found some old fusili that looked a bit suspicious, but he, no risk, no reward. Bought a broccoli to add since mal loved broccoli. Made a serviceable pasta and since mal was a huge insta person took it to the window to take beauty shots of the pasta instead of enjoying it hot. Her friends had come as well, so they had a bit as well and were impressed. I’d met both of them last time I was in mumbai, so conversed with them for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc85Wh_yf2kobc5yljyJDFBSkoRNDvhSgQRspQu1bfRucIUatmAk1BdaiIFBEB4OkkgyQi8wZCquDzHYEUHiBWPCXDF-BzpC-ko0TG-tUB7_QDZkRT4rn-rrl73Qxj-D4pOXCs7Fzg2YzpwuBW6VY46ZXA=w300-h400-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;AIL4fc85Wh_yf2kobc5yljyJDFBSkoRNDvhSgQRspQu1bfRucIUatmAk1BdaiIFBEB4OkkgyQi8wZCquDzHYEUHiBWPCXDF-BzpC-ko0TG-tUB7_QDZkRT4rn-rrl73Qxj-D4pOXCs7Fzg2YzpwuBW6VY46ZXA=w300-h400-s-no?authuser=0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her roommate came the next day, I’d met her last time I was here but hadn’t really talked much with her. This time around figured I’d get to know her as well. She’d actually come late last night after we’d slept, so hadn’t seen her then. Said hi to her in the morning but was in the “woke up late and need to get to office now” rush. I spent the day working from home, had asked mal to recommend some good cafes nearby, had gotten one called grandmamas cafe and was planning to go there. Went and worked for a while in a starbucks, it was good but wasn’t anything special. I think I got overhyped on working in starbucks and it just didn’t live upto expectations, oh well. Went to grandmamas at night and had an amazing hot chocolate and an okay pasta and came back with a food coma. Was unmoving for the rest of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc-eXldFuiOBmB8aQ-56MaA7eQ0_qFYm5cflXjyMcZ7xSS-sZd6fBu--cmZ3Cp33bDZx3KUstWdWzdLjzJpAyXKO4OrGoaKFdzyY_VL1l_oOUfelrvCugVuKMQx2hPljJnStvBxx6MuIprgf_us2cP7s2Q=w600-h337-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figured since I was here, might as well visit somewhere, Had a train station literally 100 meters from mal’s place. So wanted to go somewhere on it. Took a couple of trains and an auto to end up at juhu beach. Being spoilt by the gorgeous and sprawled out calicut beach, calling the tiny sandbox of a thing that was juhu went against my sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc8fClVamVPp_wmlsc5Bj8iOXn1BQz9DxE9LdeWrDRPmVitF_QV595_-0Q1ABeCIuJLlAyNTl2xO4iTkA1KC1QoaxDZLZbGUw9Y73eIr4VgMQ3JWn9mYrZN715mQe3cEYAkY-FkCSb3Qto-7GCZ3sM9b_Q=w600-h450-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was apparently a good cafe near the beach according to mal, I figured I’d search for it. Got bored halfway through, went in a dominos and had a pizza. Figured I’d go back, but then wanted to say that I actually made an effort to find the place. So walked on and eventually found it. It had good ambience and decor, the food was mediocre though. Apparently thats something thats common in mumbai, mediocre expensive food. So I was getting the true mumbai experince. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc9nlS646h3Q882Epk7TGAxLdhUTvWZg6l9l8cPMmqvxG1XzLpMU2YFMUt43O93qPu7sq6xtNbuTqWLuh2l_AHmHjqqj1vaQ43jWDrT1uJybxd4xPLO5ayD72L11XajrOjwIHBcren2oFVeEVO7FcLqZQg=w600-h450-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/JRsMHPkMNu9ZYs5a8&quot;&gt;raining&lt;/a&gt; and I was bored and didn’t want to work. So figured I’d go overboard and cook a full course meal. I was talking to the roommate the day before about how she’d met her husband, and how she got into her current line of work. Had gotten into the topic of food and she had expressed a craving for pasta. So figured I’d make a proper one this time around. When Mal’s friends had come last time, they’d dropped a packet of cutlets to pass along to someone else, we’d ended up cooking and eating all of those, so figured I’d make a fresh batch to pass along. This time around there wasn’t much in the pantry so had to buy all the veggies and since going overboard figured we’d make chicken pasta. Seasoned the chicken, fried it, sauted the veggies, made sauce and an amazing pasta came together. Not to toot my own horn, but I outdid myself. Saw a packet of semolina while checking pantry earlier, so going completely overboard, ended up making a ton of kheer on top of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc-dHlfpp_zK9yGLcHsemklJdn3oZ50TLtmA7YAFRtT3_mlTLmAL5JlxZ22597N0Lcm92yViCBjTtBekn2gquEaSd03RinmKKCFY1ToAO9z4T30KfauezTjrFjE0NOeeEdhPP-JHeAl0vBju5RIcEMUXuw=w600-h337-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roommate had gone out at that point. I have this thing that when I cook for multiple people, in my mind, I cook for one person, and that person has to have it whether or not others have it. Since roommate had asked for it, pasta was meant for her. Since she was out and it was getting late, had kept a note for her to inform that there was pasta and kheer and cutlets as starters. But she’d forgotten all about it even after pings reminding her and had had pizza with her friends. The treachery. It hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc-RhTYC8mGdGYmIppSyedDG4vaT7hb5sifEutlq8DqePRVphKmyMDcXZUxmtOdPlMs3GjfBFz9TwA24vf0V4nG2qsJRkGXpZGfgWFb12y7HA4L4hWXpujxK9YxYWwI9HrBAfaDbGiFtksfeMR-EzL0aow=w600-h337-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day she apologised for being late and not eating pasta and ended up taking the pasta to her office and sharing it with all her collegues, all of whom sang high praise about it. Still impresses people. Mal was playing hooky from work and was at home, her friends had come in the evening and they tried the pasta as well and they loved it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s sunday, and I’m slated to go today. Her friends were trying to get her to date me since apparently I’m a catch. Well if that isn’t a confidence boost, I don’t know what is.  I seem to like airport sandwiches a lot more than normal sandwiches for some reason, and whenever I’m in an airport I try to have a sandwich. I was planning for the same in mumbai airport and got told that it was a crappy place where there’d be no food. I argued that there’s no way that an airport wouldn’t have good food near the gates. To my chagrin and horror The airport gates looked like a crappy bus shelter. Imagine the airport gates being some desks you found in an alleyway kept in a row. There was nothing there. There was a crappy vending machine with chips, thats about it. Oh well. At least I’m spared the doubtless crappy sandwich I would have gotten from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc_uE-fyKcDMWNktL9qYCUTvatYwbF2XlXIBVuf5rwyoV4EdUWwUkiimFFuWV0coA5XA1otw9qgQW7w6-2da4oCFU3J-6f3ABWy6Xz-e8M5U3jcGWcjXEjAYiByahlZfKwEMQjW6rhTOhxT1HcgzpEm4-w=w600-h337-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;goa&quot;&gt;GOA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reached dabolim airport, opened an uber app…….. and uber doens’t work in goa. Great planning on my end. Live and learn, I guess. Got out of airport and a line of cabbies were waiting to fleece me. So turned back and ordered a cab from the prepaid counter. Having to pay more for the cab than the flight I had taken inbound. Learning that my destination zostel was in north goa and that there was an airport nearer in north goa that I could have gone to instead. During the drive he was engaging in conversation about where I was from and how it was in Kerala and stuff. Asked random shit about kerala that I knew nothing about like what it was famous for or what its export was or even who its cm was. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching in the evening being faintly concerned about staying in a hostel with random people around. Checked in, was suitably impressed by the open place and the cleanliness. Was too afraid to socialize with people there, everybody seemed to already know each other and were sitting in groups and there didn’t seem to be any easy way to get in in any of those, so sat in the center of the common area in a comfy chair and just watched and listened to audiobooks instead. I might need to strap in for a looooong lonely week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc_BEXKDLCf8QL2RfCfxhlLzLQPDjztnMcDWmD8UR59dB_VeoRetPeSmLYJPLrzZZh5T4H-Pzfeo4RN9SjBPKdwSYNP8un8y_qD_9yf9Xj0odAS9yWfRnm2rLkqNklx5Y_fBzqiwsCQI9J2tCGzM4YPyPg=w600-h337-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;common room pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck this. Figured I’d to the beach instead. Morjim beach is literally a km from there. And google shows a path through some inner ways to walk there. Let’s go. It had rained earlier and theres huge puddles on the way and I’m wearing a shoe that can’t be wet. Carefully, Caaarefully made my way around the puddles, jumped the ones and mission impossible’d others eventually to get to a place where the road was just a lake. Theres no way I’m going in there. Sigh. This means I need to backtrack the 1.5km I walked, walk another 1.5km the other proper way to get to the beach. Well, its not like I’m short on time, let’s go. After reversing all the way and a fairly boring walk later I’m greeted with an empty stretch of beach. Compared to the clusterfuck of baga and candolim, this is utterly peaceful. Sat on a sand ledge and just watched the waves for a good long while. The cafes seemed to be closing inordinately early here compared to the other beaches. Then beach was even more serene after the lights of the cafes were gone. Spent some more time there. Eventually making my way back and getting to my room. The music was blaring till after midnight, but eventually fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc8vSdOsdASq0LyBc6mz-JYeJ1BQw6pacBdzKOntyrv3edkOPT_wb02u5IOeshHneb2EZsEir_BXlWEXiiEprXvplos5i34lKrjH8MqnbUy_kNR1wLA_UgdHzWTM07qEnZePv-QPXxoY40JsLnjz_nzi7Q=w600-h450-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day was turning out to be a loooong one. I didn’t meet anyone. Spent the day in the common area chair with audiobooks. Had my laptop in the workstation and worked in between. At this point work was “run a script, wait an hour, see output” kind, so had a ton of time to be bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc9gCFKHc5A2zG493kSnBAjPpGoc8gaXgyMRwgJ0QcyK1nZ9xXzz8WE_6HEx9CV0A6K9dMwKu921wPPeq9rMeJDnsAzzWo-dOZRkClntiGfr9kQXWJmrssaq_n7zVvXMqsOfV-3VuuFNGmeOlGJdQ2zMQQ=w600-h337-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw someone I wanted to talk to and saw that they were in the adjascent room to mine. Today was the day I start talking to people. Aaaand nothing. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw a couple of people who went to that same room and also to my room. They were arguing with the staff about something. Eventually one of them came and set their stuff in my room and I asked them what the matter was. They had a bum leg and the other one was heavyset and both of them were given top bunks. After a lot of arguing one bottom bunk was given. So wanting to do a good turn, getting to be friendly with these folks and having an excuse to talk to the other person, decided to switch with them. They were slated to leave Thursday. So I exchanged my lower bunk bed for a top bunk in the other room. The person I wanted to talk to wasn’t in the room at all. Talked to the ones that I exchanged my bunks with. He was a day trader in dubai and had come to vacation with his family. His family had went back home and he was now here for a couple more days with his college friend. Talked about trading and some other shit for a while, finally ticking the box of striking up a conversation with a stranger for more than five minutes. The literal goal of this entire expedition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked more then went to my new room and got on my bunk. Met my roommate who was in the bottom bunk who had roommate vibe, I still don’t know what exactly he works as. Just that he works in mutual funds to decide what they invest in as a consultant. So he’d be the person who investigates about companies and his data would be sold to people who manage funds to make decisions. At least thats what I understood. He was from blore and takes a trip every so often. Let’s call him roomie. He had a spirit mountain, as in he liked one particular mountain enough to get a tattoo of it on his arm and calls it his spirit mountain. He’s been to everest base camp and was unimpressed. But went on a trip to this other mountain range for a week long trek around it and beset by its beauty had captured it. Since that trek and that view of the mountain meant so much to him, he got it tattooed on him. He told me about a nearby goan breakfast place that apparently serves good goan bread. So figured I’d check it out later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night finally saw the person I wanted to talk to. They were sick. Their partner and they had driven all the way from baroda in gujarat, spent a couple of nights in goa and were returning the next morning, so much for moving, but hey, found roomie through it, so the move was already worth it. They were a business analyst. Half the people on the trip seem to be in IT, since they seem to be the only people who can work and travel at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning walked a couple kms to the goan place, was whelmed by the pao (the goan bread) and their breakfast selection. As I entered the place saw a drawing of a dude who triggered a sense of deja vu, I kept thinking that I knew the person, but for the life of me could not remember who it was. For some reason kept thinking it was Hamilton .At this point was trying to get my step goal in the morning as I wake up before the start of the day, so by the end of the day would have a massive surplus and feel good about it. So walking to breakfast seemed like a no brainer, although the breakfast did end up being meh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc98W5bNHsMHXgjCITiQFM_gJUJF1i1ycLhHX49zWooe_pAtVXybzm-2xB-Y3YeQl62AqTUzKdZ4eY8O226XeDN5kUN2Ut9C1edzlf8w8MY62jwTmV0BDuGb-LZ_lHA9XfcbR1bWEW3ZblWkVJkYhyxlgQ=w337-h600-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cafe in the zostel had a variety of items and all of it was mediocre. I was going through their menu one by one and each item was as mediocre as the last and pricey to boot. But they seemed to be up front about it, and there were a lot of alternatives available nearby, so It didn’t seem like a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a TT table near the workstation, so in between bouts of work, would go and play with people around. There was a guy wearing a long kurta who had the typical “out of work writer” look. With a boisterous loud fun personality. He was really good at TT and soundly beat me in multiple games. Got to talking with him. He was also from baroda. Trained to be an archeologist, but couldn’t be arsed to do that, instead became a chef and has lived and worked as a chef in seven countries, and was back home for an extended holiday. Met another playing TT, a 22 year old steel merchant from mumbai. He managed his entire company from his phone and pretty much nonstop had calls. You meet all kinds of people when you travel with career paths that are wildly different to your narrow views of whats possible. Its fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met another who used to be a product manager but could not be bothered anymore, said bubbye at work and was in goa to destress. Someone else had brought a dog to the common room and she was playing with the dog. It had rained earlier and the dog was playing in the puddles racing against the people. The dog seemed to have an infinite well of energy and it was a lot of fun to watch. Tried my hand and realised that I’m way too lazy to be active with the dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sick analyst had left by then, and another business analyst had taken their place. Met him and he was from blore as well. Talked shop about what he did and how since he was a consultant he could float around without having to goto office. Met another roommate from panipat who was again in goa with family, and family had gone and was here to enjoy for the last two days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw a couple of people playing chess. Wanted to play as well but chickened out and walked away. Nooo. Not today. After psyching myself up, I walked back and asked if I could play as well. Turns out it was one party teaching chess to the other. They were cousins on vacation. One was a first year in college learning cs and the other was her cousin from London. They were here to basically go clubbing non stop and were whiling away the daytime with assorted entertainment. Ended up playing a couple of games and winning handily. Got more spectators. One of them tried to help me by physically moving my pieces. Didn’t like it one bit, so got them to help the opponents instead. Eventually the cousins went away and the analyst took their place. The steel merchant was spectating and occasionally helping him. Played a couple games with them and squeaked out wins in both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc8TnPg2hpWAYTohE0oT7dnfdz5JOO4ilwob4jei9z99CTyYoIh5JzuhDXmJn5Mk6ZChUoCfhYlEJLABr8r-DgSdPhEokW-QL2BOpuhYORQGdA-JYW7ELxKEb_B2HKqbf7LaocyCYhXC_0AcNnMlGdLGCw=w600-h450-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening there was a poker game running. It was pay to play, some wanted it to be free, but the steel merchant insisted that it would spoil any fun in it. I hadn’t ever gambled real money before. Said fuck it, called it the price of entertainment and played with the 500 buy in. Either beginners luck or good play, ended up walking away at the end of the game 500 bucks richer. Definitely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc8shqQScnGZ3nHSglppc9WZ239jKWzrp1CI928UpXq43beAZ2V_3j5ABqM0FtBp5pJKAbNwcFEo1o3ZYjYP2U0CIvzQShyIFEXuEsIt9Mak-cBBTkyApTr8NZ8NjlMlekbvy6Xgh50KuZ6oYck0PPBwnw=w600-h337-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met a group of doctors from kerala, who were working in blore? They just got done with their residency and was planning on emigrating to the UK, so had come on a weeklong bender to goa, staying in a different hostel each night and partying it up in each place. They’d brought along vodka and were planning to have shots at night, got an invite and figured I might as well check it out.  At night went to their room. They’d went to a nearby shop to get lemons and salt. One of them had a nasty scar across his hand, and talked about an accident with as a pinion on a bike with his cousin and being out of contact from home and being scared of telling the cousins dad that they had an accident, ending up with a rod in his arm. Fun. Anyway, had a shot of vodka from there, they were planning to go to a friends place in Goa then, so said goodbye and came back to my room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workstation we had had a cocunut tree growing in the center of it, so the roof curved around it, so when it rained, water would still make its way into the workstation and pool in the center, thankfully the edges weren’t subject to this. Today the temperature seemed to be an uncomfortable 16 degrees and everyone seemed to be wearing jackets. Finally gather confidence, I asked if anybody actually wanted this temperature, no one did, everyone just assumed that someone else wanted it and not speaking up. Fun. Was way too proud of myself for that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sort of work I had during this week was optimizing a build. So basically the build would be a multi gb single entity without caching, so I had to break it down in to seperate layers and cache it. For that, I had a lot of ways it could be done, some giving positive results, some not. So took some time and listed out the options and made a script to run the options, and then combinations of options, note down the time, and the size each build took and find the optimal build. What this meant is I could start running it and I’d pretty much be free the rest of the time. This gave me a lot of time to play around with. So in goa, ostensibly working from home, but actually just free coz the work is automated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend was going having a rough time, so bought some flowers and chocolate to cheer her up. Apparently it works on some but not on others. Happily, she liked it. After lunch came back to room to find that my stuff had been packed up. When asked the people who I had exchanged with were checking out today, and their beds were not changed with mine in the system, so assuming I was checking out, they had put all my shit in the container. So went and got that sorted out. Basically they don’t have a way of changing it in the system, so just said fuck it and asked them to write it down, knowing it was futile and I’d face the same thing the next day. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chef from baroda was going away that day, so said goodbye to him. Met a sleazeball who was there just to ogle at people. There was another poker game today with a smaller 200 rs buy in. Since the chess cousins were playing and they were new, had reduced the buy in. Figured might as well. It was me, the steel merchant, the guy from paniput, the cousins and the sleazeball in the game. I should prolly start using names. Descriptions are harder to remember than just a name I guess. Oh well we’ll see where anonymity ends. Roomie came around and sat to my right and a new person sat to my left. Names, lets start naming people, let’s call her sam. So sam doesn’t know how to play poker. So I was teaching her while playing my hand. In the end it ended up being me, roomie and sam playing poker as a team, sam learning the game, and roomie just commenting on what to play. Ended up winning this time around as well. We transitioned to playing uno, and a lot more people joined in. We played for a long while going multiple rounds and having different rules from different regions clash and bitter rivalries cropping up, so basically a normal game of uno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc9NgIjuBZYgnx87wUYKq2errq0cficT0H-CBc_KZ7r8vwt8CTMK9BhMxskPlIiOnrlGrcrbSWHVpOqN3QADr3IOK3uF8ZrTLxPeb1LvFVmFdLv5lOuaBKAMAThSOjKtA-cUNn83-U_mOfeBTv6pUgh2-w=w600-h450-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc9meBmhaYadfitMbNxlEwR32xvlztFKAGEiVnFF3EX4Kz54P6s0x9MWDjNQh3So8EpSYLtYBcU8xSa4MyC7y3HtAJPQV1lxbzBJcnJACHgUPKL385_ivQY1a5oP-OrQPdlXfRn9hK0szYHmSr3DKGRiAg=w450-h600-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After uno, me roomie and sam went to the tt area. The cousins came around at this point and I started playing carroms with them and another of my roommates, a friend of theirs, a party animal who’d stay up till 2 and THEN start to goto baga or some other beach bar with them. Basically would be back by five or six in the morning. Not sure how or when these guys slept. I sunk the queen and its followup with backshots and was proud of that. Talked with sam, assumed she did the same thing as roomie when I heard that it was something to do with mutual funds and deciding whether to buy or not. Got told that it was infact nothing similar. I never understood why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc_4d7oRWxdki1f6PVnO0Ww0wjgY8NvSxAuniIipWpqRoAx9bcTYkvv-MwL3BLnQW8N87mCtJEQW0HsfR4w_3xnUbUYyhvaPEQdD5tVYMcCl8bUrkh_ZqqyorKV0k-pYjmxgyXTCNgnmRU9XFOhbW3QnWg=w600-h450-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When told that I hadn’t really gone out of the zostel and was just here to talk to people, sam was aghast and pushed me to go out and sight see. Ended up making plans with her to take roomies scooter and roam around the nearby beaches and sights the next day at six am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of people, the partner of an american who had come there, and a lady from mumbai who struck up a fast friendship, they were drunk within the next hour and dancing while drinking for a long time, when it rained, they moved the dance session into the rain. I think they danced non stop for about four hours while drinking. Thats some endurance. Damn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woke up at five thirty ready for the trip, realised it was raining heavily, took a screenshot of the weather report and sent it off to sam assuming the trip would be cancelled/postponed. went out to the covered area once I’d properly woken up and walked till the daily step counter was filled. It stopped raining at 9 and figured out that sam hadn’t even woken up. Called her up and berated her for standing me up, and then told her that it was actually raining till now. so we shifted it to go at 10. She works with uk folk so her work doesn’t start till 12. So she was free. Me having automated my stuff was also free most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we took the scooter and went to ashvem beach. There wasn’t much of a beach there, just a sheer rock cliff with an inaccessible beach on the other side of it. Underwhelmed and shooing off the hair braid and bracelet saleswomen, made our way to the next beach, mandrem. A much better beach, even better than morjim, the closest one I’d gone the first day. Took a few pictures there, since she was a massive instagram addict spent time taking videos/images that could be converted to instagram reels/posts and was talking about how she might spend hours editing or choosing the correct song. Could not for the life of me understand how. The friend in mumbai had the same issue. While coming back there were a few dogs there, so spent some time trying to befriend them, she had some leftover food in her bag and tried to bribe them into liking her to no avail. It was raining on and off at this point, thankfully roomie had a poncho in the scooter. After an embarrassingly long time trying to figure out how to put on this raincoat and finally figuring out that it was indeed a poncho, wore it and left from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc8WmH0ZvKNlbZHS3cgOvhxKf9nZIicRfEGBGDoUbV0ioSPNxkydO0wIKA5Ggg4hTcNjxIzYcO8TaDIPa5y99X8BcnE8bEVGp1dYUtvDi8GR8egB--MtwTmIQNdTViSP9F-FvHhwMRtvqJdVEXzkPzPOHg=w600-h450-s-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next place was a dam. arampol dam I think it was. Following the directions given by google, we snaked our way through alleyways and finally reached….. some random old persons house. Whelp. Figured the last part was wrong since it was off the road, so circled around and went offroad for a bit finally finding some people in a car, figuring it was other tourists we made our way there, only to realize it was people from the electricity board here to fix a pole. Well, I guess arampol doesn’t want us. We turned back put some fuel in the scooter and made our way to the next spot, a quarry, after some off road travel and a bit of a hike, we found the quarry and it was worth it. By then roomie was worried and wanted the scooter to get somewhere, so we skipped the next beach, morjim (the nearest one) and made our way back to the zostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc_NEtE_W5BOONWZpITreJCcdteJ9rINx4y2K6iIctTNHZhyY2L7STdaF_54zyO8JeEfqiNByuktLrBrIh4SF0Vwi5ZOyTYObTU_td6usvT0qmsb4NflNMmHGn1oiCSmLw6tL26bO9IYnNu0H-h4MrjbIw=w600-h337-s-k-no?authuser=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went back and worked for a bit, and when it was lunch time for her after her call, by like 3. She wanted goan bread. Figured another person deserved to be whelmed, we went to the goan place. We accidentallly let in a dog that was pining to get into the place, and the owners shooed it out. Got whelmed by the lunch options and the bread again. I knew I might get my feet wet in the morning, so was wearing sandals, but this time around I figured we’d only goto the food place, so had worn my shoes, that can’t be washed. We had the food, and made our way back a bit, then since she wanted to shop for a dream catcher and some dresses, we went shopping. At this point, the weather had had enough and it started raining cats and dogs. we went from shop to shop in the pouring rain sharing an umbrella I had brought, finding different dream catches, none apparently good enough for her, and being from delhi, haggling seems to be something she’s well versed in. Eventually ended up not buying dream catchers or dresses, but bought a flower pot cozy and a hand bag made of jute instead. I’ll never understand how shopping is supposed to work with women, for me its always go in, get stuff, pay, get out. We had missed morjim in the morning and she wanted to go there now, so in the pouring rain we made our way there, an empty beach, pouring rain and two idiots under an umbrella. Somehow it actually was good. My shoes are a wash at this point (get it?). and we make our way back, me squelching with each step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its friday evening, and sam is leaving for the hostel she had stayed in earlier in the week in panjim to get the rest of her luggage and go the next day. roomie was extending his stay every day by one day instead of having a booking for a week, and he hadn’t gotten a booking for friday night either and was planning on going back home. Figured might as well jump hostels and goto panjim. Gave up my bed to sleazeball, since zostel wouldn’t refund it anyway. And the three of us made our way to panjim. She wanted to buy stuff from the flea market in the way, but by then it was too late and we made our way directly instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked in to the white belcao, a lot more homey cozy kind of hostel which was something roomie absolutely loved, he didn’t particularly like the frachisey, commercialised vibe the zostel had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met a guy, lets call him ray, working as an intern, who was a student in liverpool but was in his third year and needed an internship, so during the holidays he was interning in a company in goa. He was working with llm’s. I didn’t really wanna socialize since I only had two days here and thought I wouldn’t get anything deeper from that. So didn’t dig deep even though I was interested. Met another couple of guys who were in zostel and had left earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way to a pub, after being denied entry into a club coz there was no stag entry there. Sam wanted to dance, so while the others were taking a smoke break, she quietly went and partied in the club. The others bought a round of beer and we had some peanut kind of dish as an entree as well. The live music in the pub was really good, and at one point an elderly couple were dancing to the tunes. It was fun. After drinks, collected sam and made our way back to the hostel. Taking the scenic route with ray taking the role of the local guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day sam had her flight. She needed to go to the bus stop in the morning, I had rented a scooty for the weekend in panjim, so volunteered to drop her off. Inhaled the rest of my food coz it was late and went in search of a bus stop. Realized that the first one we stopped was the private stand and wasn’t where we were supposed to be. Got to the proper stand. Instead of regular bus, got told that there were shuttles to the airport, so took ticket to that instead. Got her situated and was helping a granny behind her with her bags when I hear “jump off” from behind me. not realizing what it was, I look around to see the doors locked and the bus starting to move. So I give granny the bag, shout a hurried goodbye and jump off the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the guys from yesterday also had his flight, but he had to make his way with a big fuck off bag, all the way to vasco from where he had rented his scooty before he could board his flight. So said bye to him as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went with roomie to a nearby fort the same day, called rais magos fort. It was a defensive fort against sea invasion, and had cannons facing the sea, and currently had artwork in some of the rooms. We spent like twenty minutes there. After exiting, right outside the fort, we saw a tiny tea shop with the ocean view and comfortable chairs, so we ordered some tea and relaxed there for a couple of hours &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/xgxcw8s84AgoSbc29&quot;&gt;watching the waves&lt;/a&gt;. That was honestly more worth than the fort. The drive and the ocean view were worth the drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roomie had bus at night, so dropped him off. I figured since I had only half a day more, I wouldn’t do any more socialization, but said fuck it and decided to interact more. We ended up deciding to go for a movie, ray, me and the last guy, lets call him pras. Since ray had already seen barbie we figured we’d go for mission impossible, only to realize that was too late and the only thing available was barbie. Ended up watching barbie instead and thats two hours of my life I’m not getting back. Came back and talked to ray more, and got more info on a lot of cool stuff, he was basically trying to integrate chat gpt into their product, and I learnt of langchain, the python library that deals with a lot of language model stuff. I figured I’d do a personal project on it whenever I next got a chance. (Ha just you wait, said fate, unheard by me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, me and pras had near enough flights that we figured we’d share a cab. Called the original cab I’d come from the airport after bargaining him down since it was closer to the airport and since goa miles, their version of uber was showing a lower amount. He eventually agreed, and we made our way to the airport. On the way, he asked me about the cm again, and again I had no answer. Not sure if I should have studied up or what. Anyway, we got to the airport, had a kfc and waited around till eventually it was time for my flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto….&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This happened in real life while I was going back home from bangalore on 14th April 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My shoes are ruined, my socks are drenched, and I’m happy. I’m at carmelaram railway station and it’s raining cars and dogs here. I’m sitting underneath the waiting shed and still having to use an umbrella because the rain and wind is too strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while or waiting around an old man and woman came slowly up to where I was sitting. They were waiting on someone coming from the next shed with an umbrella. He was here to pick them up from the station. He was a younger man. So I assumed the old man and woman would share and umbrella and walk together. But the guy has trouble walking and needs assistance so the young guy is walking with him to support him and the old woman is walking ahead intending to just go in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I debated with myself about how I’d introduce myself and ask if they needed help. What ended up happening is that they stepped into the rain. And I gathered my things. And walked along with the woman and held my umbrella out to her. She was surprised at first and then smiled. We walked slowly along the station. There was a lot of water and my shoes were immediately drenched. She had her slippers in her hands. We were going the opposite way to the entrance intending to take the railway crossing just after the station since the main entrance was extremely muddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the end of the station is near the husband is asking her repeatedly to be careful about her step. And she kept saying she didn’t have a hand free since she was holding her slippers. So ended up taking her slippers from her offering an arm. She got down the end of the station walked a couple steps on the rocks on bare feet and then on to the railway crossing. And onto the road. She put on her slippers then. But they were immediately drowned in more water on the road. My shoes and socks were pretty much filled to the brim by then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We crossed the road and the younger man went ahead to get the car and the man and woman stood there sharing the umbrella. And I made my exit and came back with colder feet, and a warmer heart.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">This happened in real life while I was going back home from bangalore on 14th April 2022</summary></entry></feed>
